# FSR Compiler 2.0

Optifine CIT File Creator for Hypixel Skyblock by Cunuduh (ping invalid-user#7279 on Discord if there are bugs)

## .exe file?

I'm a trustworthy FSR artist. I would never distribute malware. If it bothers you, you can copy the source code and build it yourself.

## How it works

The 'Sprite Name' text box is used for the name of the sprite and the initial name of the file created.

Item Type dictates the type of item used. Certain buttons and text boxes will unlock if a certain type is picked.

Vanilla Item is the Minecraft item/block being textured. Multiple items can be entered (for example armour pieces), but items following the first item need to have 'minecraft:' in the front.

The Skyblock ID is the ID of the item being textured. Enabling 'Use item name' check box will make it use the item's name instead.

Custom NBT is enabled with the 'Use custom NBT' check box. You can enter the weight of the item texture, or use any extra NBT attributes of the item itself. Press enter to create a new line.

Lore is enabled with the 'Use lore' check box. Use this if you want the item to be textured based on its lore (the description of the item in-game).

Custom texture/model paths are used if you want to reference a texture or model from another folder.

Leather overlay is to be enabled if the armour icon/model uses a leather armour piece.
